Voice Controlled Car, Jae Hyen Kim

Hello! Thanks for checking out my project!

The story behind this and the build instructions can be found here:
https://www.hackster.io/jae-kim2/voice-controlled-toy-car-fcd8af

Once built, in order to run this project as-is, simply navigate to the
directory that the code is in and type: ./run (assuming you're using the
same set-up in the cloud9 or a similar terminal). This should properly
configure all your pins and start moving the car. If you want to give
the car different instructions, simply go to the "speech.py" file and
modify the main script and add whatever directions you want.
